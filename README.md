# Personal Savings Tracker

Beginning Jan 1, 2016 I started the 365 Day Money Challenge. My goal is to set aside some extra cash for a trip from Seattle to Louisiana for my cousin's wedding at the beginning of 2017. I have to admit that I've missed a day or two already, so I wanted to create something that would: (1) Help me track the days I've paid up and which I've missed, (2) Tell how much I owe based on the date, and (3) Help me calculate a total amount I owe if I've missed multiple days. 

To read more about this challenge, check out this article: http://www.savingadvice.com/articles/2014/01/01/1019727_365-day-money-challenge.html

I could download and print the chart in the article, but let's be honest, this is more fun.
